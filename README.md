# AI-Driven Multi-Day Energy Demand Forecasting for ISO Planning
Reliable energy demand forecasting is a foundational requirement for Independent System Operators (ISOs) and National Energy System Operators (NESOs). Accurate short- to medium-term forecasts support operational scheduling, network reliability, market efficiency, and long-term whole-system planning across electricity, gas, hydrogen, and emerging low‑carbon vectors.

This report documents an end-to-end case study involving the development of an AI‑driven, batch-trained energy demand forecasting system capable of producing 1‑day, 2‑day, and 3‑day ahead forecasts. The work demonstrates how advanced data engineering, feature stores, and machine‑learning models can be operationalised to support ISO decision‑making, regional energy strategy planning, and evidence‑based policy development.

<p>For any business, gaining and understanding insights into future trends, customer demands, or market conditions is an important factor in success. And with the wide availability of machine learning and artificial intelligence tools, thousands of businesses are able to enhance their operations through time series forecasting. in this design we introduced time series forecasting using Python and AI and shows how you can apply them to your business. Learn how to translate forecasting workflows from static, classroom problems to dynamic, real-time use cases. Plus, find out about the tools and approaches you can apply to other AI and machine learning tasks.</p>
<p>This course is integrated with GitHub Codespaces, an instant cloud developer environment that offers all the functionality of your favorite IDE without the need for any local machine setup. With GitHub Codespaces, you can get hands-on practice from any machine, at any time—all while using a tool that you’ll likely encounter in the workplace. Check out the “GitHub Codespaces” video to learn how to get started.</p>

_See the readme file in the main branch for updated instructions and information._
## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
